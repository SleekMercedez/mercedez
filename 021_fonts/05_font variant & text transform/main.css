/*other fonts include pixels, viewport and rem: view port can be used when you want font size to be relative to webpage sixe. rem is good cos it is relative to the root of the default browser font setting, so even if someone locally changes font size, rem is still relative to all that*/


/*font weight ranges from bold, bolder, lighter or can even be measured with numbers 100-900*/

/*font style also has many variations*/
